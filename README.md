## Requirements
To run and simulate robots using this repo, you'll need the following:
- **RoboDK** (free or licensed version)
- **Python 3.8+** (for running Python scripts)
- **C++ compiler** (optional, if using C++ robot control code)
- Basic understanding of robotics, automation, and kinematics

## Installation and Setup
### Step 1: Install RoboDK
1. Download and install **RoboDK** from [RoboDK Official Website](https://robodk.com/download).
2. Follow the instructions to set up the software. You can use the **free license** version.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kondwani0099/aut-robo-dk-simulations.git
cd aut-robo-dk-simulations
```

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Install the required packages for Python code by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Using RoboDK Free License
RoboDK offers a free license with limitations on the number of robots and project sizes. Here’s how you can maximize the free license:
- **Small-Scale Projects**: Create smaller simulation projects or use simpler robotic models available in RoboDK's free version.
- **Trial License**: Explore more features during the free trial period.
- **Learning**: Utilize this repository's example codes and simulations to learn about robot programming before deciding on a premium license.

For detailed licensing options, visit the [RoboDK Licensing Page](https://robodk.com/compare).

## Usage Instructions
1. **Open RoboDK**: After installing, launch the RoboDK software.
2. **Load Simulation Files**: Open the `.rdk` simulation files located in the `simulations/` folder using RoboDK.
3. **Run Python Scripts**: Use the Python API to automate simulations or control robots. Example scripts are provided in the `scripts/` directory.
   - Example of running a Python script:
     ```bash
     python control_robot.py
     ```
4. **Edit and Customize**: Modify simulation parameters or robot code to fit your project needs.
